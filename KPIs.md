Make sure the dashboard dynamically queries the data to calculate these KPIs. I would like to see the calculated per month

    Sales Revenue: Sum of transaction_qty * unit_price for each product sold, grouped by month and location.

    Average Transaction Value (ATV): Average of total transaction values, calculated for each transaction first and then averaged for each month per location.
    
    Peak Sales Hours: Hours with the highest sales volumes, identified by counting transactions in each hour, grouped by month and location.

    Product Mix Efficiency: Revenue contribution of each product category to the total sales revenue, displayed as a percentage, filtered by month and location.S
